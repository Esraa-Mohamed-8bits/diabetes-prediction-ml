`Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning`
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes using machine learning techniques.
The model is trained on medical diagnostic data and aims to assist in early detection by analyzing key health indicators.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in machine learning and data science, with an emphasis on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**Results**

The trained model demonstrates good performance in predicting diabetes based on medical attributes.
Further improvements can be achieved by:

-Hyperparameter tuning

-Trying additional models

-Using cross-validation
